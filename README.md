sdlocker-tiny
=============

Attiny85-based device to enable and disable write-protection on any SD card  
[![sdlocker-tiny built inside the shell of an old PlayStation Memory Card](https://github.com/Nephiel/sdlocker-tiny/blob/gh-pages/img/sdlocker-tiny-sm.jpg)](https://github.com/Nephiel/sdlocker-tiny/blob/gh-pages/img/sdlocker-tiny.jpg)

Based on sdlocker by karllunt, see http://www.seanet.com/~karllunt/sdlocker.html


I routinely use USB drives loaded with software tools and benchmarks to diagnose and fix computers. I wanted a way to protect those drives from viruses, malware, filesystem corruption and accidental erases.

USB drives with a write-protect switch do exist, but are hard to find and expensive.

The sdlocker allows me to write-protect any SD card and use it inside a USB card reader as a read-only USB drive.

This is my own fork of the original sdlocker, tailored to suit my needs - smaller, simpler, and USB-powered.


Changes from original sdlocker
------------------------------

- Ported from Atmega328 to Attiny85
- Removed all the UART code and unused functions
- Rewrote the interface (1 button, 1 LED)


Schematic
---------

- See sdlocker-tiny.cpp for ASCII schematic.
- The button and LED share the same pin on the Attiny.
- The RESET pin on the Attiny is left unconnected.  
  You could change the fuses to turn it into another I/O pin, but then you wouldn't be able to flash the chip again without a HV programmer.
- The SD card socket has a card-detect switch that shorts a pin to ground when a card is inserted.  
  I used this pin as ground to cut the power to the device while there is no card.
- To turn the 5V from USB into 3.3V, I used a Texas Instruments LM3940 + 2 capacitors  
  (see the LM3940 datasheet, "Typical application")
- Both the Attiny85 and the SD card run on 3.3V. Do not power them with 5V from USB!  
  The Attiny can take it, but the card will be destroyed.


Compiling and Flashing
----------------------

The provided makefile uses avr-gcc and avrdude. Edit it to match your programmer.  
Run 'make' to compile and 'make program' to flash.


Device Usage
------------

The LED shows the state of the inserted card at all times:
- Steady off: card is unlocked (writable)
- Steady on: card is locked (write-protected)
- Blinking, fast: device is reading the card
- Blinking, slow: card is faulty or not properly inserted

Holding the button down (over half a second) toggles the write-protection of the card.
